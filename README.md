About me: I am Senior Class Electrical-Electronics Engineering student. Since I was young, 
I have been working in our family company, I also worked as a manager in various nongovernmental
organizations. My goal is to be both an individual with a strong social side
and an academically successful engineer, my biggest target of my life is "to be useful to
humanity in the future as an engineer." I intend to serve humanity in various electronic
fields, especially electric cars, such as "Power Electronics - Renewable Energy Resources
Lithium-Ion Battery Systems - Artificial Intelligence and Automobiles". My plans are
based on these topics. I think I am a good leader because I am a versatile engineer and I
adapt to two different life processes. I still participate in social areas and have been a
leader in all areas where I worked for. I am not a hierarchical manager, but a manager
who acts with team spirit. So I can say very clearly that with every performance I
perform, I have earned the respect and appreciation of my colleagues. I am a person
who has adopted the mentality that the only option for me is to be successful. As you
can see, my certificates and awards have already proved of everything. I am ambitious
and success-oriented, I have a strong social aspect and a good managerial personality.
Also, I always focus on "people and technology relations" in my thoughts. My life motto:
"Success is my only option, failure's not."
